From the data above, we can conclude that:
- The mean temperature in June is about 75 degrees while in December it is 71 degrees, Also, June's 50th percentile is 75% compare to 71% for December..
- Furthermore, standard deviation in December is about 3.75 while in June it is about 3.26 what means that the temperature values in December.
- For 25th and 75th percentile, the temperature in June stays between 73 and 77 degrees while in December it is between 74 and 69. In both cases the temperature is good for surfing.

## Summary
There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. (5 pt)
Heat and good temp is great to consider for a surf shop, but W. Avy mentioned the last surf shop he invested in went under because it got "rained out." We'd want to go above this and also gather data on wave patterns near the specific location we are looking at to attract more of the surfer crowd and also explore the data set with more queries on the weather at large.

Also, as noted above, the temps for the minimum / lowest temp are what are most different between June and December. I would run queries to determine what time of the day is colder, and how long that cold temp in June lasts.
